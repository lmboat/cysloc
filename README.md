The CysLoC Database and mass spectrometry processing were created and developed by Lisa Boatner.

About: Proteinaceous cysteines function as essential sensors of cellular redox state. Consequently, defining the
cysteine redoxome is a key challenge for functional proteomic studies. While proteome-wide inventories
of cysteine oxidation state are readily achieved using established, widely adopted proteomic methods
such as OxICAT, Biotin Switch, and SP3-Rox, these methods typically assay bulk proteomes and therefore
fail to capture protein localization-dependent oxidative modifications. Here we establish the local cysteine
capture (Cys-LoC) and local cysteine oxidation (Cys-LOx) methods, which together yield compartment-specific cysteine capture and quantitation of cysteine oxidation state. Benchmarking of the Cys-LoC method
across a panel of subcellular compartments revealed more than 3,500 cysteines not previously captured
by whole-cell proteomic analysis. Application of the Cys-LOx method to LPS-stimulated immortalized murine
bone marrow-derived macrophages (iBMDM), revealed previously unidentified, mitochondrially localized
cysteine oxidative modifications upon pro-inflammatory activation, including those associated with oxidative
mitochondrial metabolism.
